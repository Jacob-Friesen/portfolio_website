The user can create, add or edit any movie. Movies                                   have data about their title, director(s), actors, description etc. This project was designed with another student for my                                   Human Computer Interaction course. The focus was on user interaction not developing an entire application so the database                                   is just an XML file and there may be some small display glitches.",

They are scheduled based on thier condition severity and when the available                                   resources to treat them are ready. There are 2 types of resources: doctors and the rooms the patient is operated in. If two                                   patients have the same condition the first one that requests treatment is treated first. This project was done for my Object                                   Orientation (Comp 2150) course.",

The contact info includes variables like phone                                   numbers which is read from a XML file. Using this application you can add, delete or edit any entry clicked on in the list                                   display. This was done as part of an assignment I had in my current Human Computer Interaction course.",
