Portfolio Website
=================

My new integrated mobile desktop portfolio website (under development). The prototype can be found [here](http://jacobfriesen.xen.prgmr.com:9002). This is the culmination of my attempts at making an interface with no comprimises; 
 
 * Single domain with no unecessary scripts for any interface (A problem with most media query based adaptations)
 * Full AJAX page loads (only about 20ms) yet fully bookmarkable
 * A unified object oriented approach for all the JS
 * Full testing of server side and client side

Architecture (So far)
=====================               

Selector

Mobile_System.js
OR
Desktop_System.js

Testing
