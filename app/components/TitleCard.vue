        Hello, I am a software developer with over 10 years of experience. I have deep experience in in client side, server
        side and phone environments. I have worked in many different environments over the years including ranging from
        startups, to the government to large companies. Alongside this I have worked as a back end, front end and full stack
        developer. One highlight is scaling the startup Zimit's software from no product to a $90 million exit in five years.
